        "Inheritance in Python is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (known as a child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (known as a parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n"

        "\n",
        "2. **Derived Class (Child Class)**: The class that inherits from the base class. It can add its own properties and methods or override existing ones.\n",

        "4. **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class can inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
